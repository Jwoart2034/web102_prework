## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the main challenges was understanding how to effectively use JavaScript array methods such as `filter`, `reduce`, and `sort` to manipulate the game data without mutating the original arrays. Additionally, ensuring that DOM updates occurred correctly without duplicating elements required careful use of helper functions to clear and re-render content. These challenges were resolved by tracing the logic step by step and reusing modular functions for rendering and filtering.

## Future Improvements
- Add a search bar to filter games by name.
- Add sorting controls (pledged amount, backers, percent funded).
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
- Add a “percent funded” progress bar on each game card.
